\section{Fitting Results on data after unblinding}
\label{sec:result}

Here are results of the interesting variables from the fitting on the data after the unblinding.
The results serve as central values, with only statistical errors here.
The projection plots of each signal $q^2$ bin from the fitting are provided.
The fit procedure is describe in detail in sec.~\ref{sec:fitseq}.
The statistical uncertainties evaluation is described in sec.~\ref{sec:statUncert}.
The systematic uncertainties are described and evaluated, included those after blinding, are described in sec~\ref{sec:syst}.

If not otherwise specified, we are using the fitting procedures described in Sect.\ref{sec:fitseq} and other relevant sections.


\subsection{Statistical uncertainties determination}\label{sec:statUncert}

The determination of the statistical uncertainties for the measured parameters cannot just be delegated to the fit software, and in particular to MINOS, due to the presence of physical boundaries on the parameters themself.
These boundaries are discussed in sec.~\ref{WHERE}, and comes from the requirement that the {\tt pdf} is positive defined everywhere.

Different approaches to the problem have been explored: in the following we describe three of them: {\tt custom MINOS}, {\tt hybrid frequentist-bayesian}, and {\tt Feldman-Cousins}.
For the final determination of the statistical uncertainties we have used the latter method, despite of its complexity and the huge cpu time required.

The former two methods are described in detail in appendix~\ref{sec:CM-Hyb}, and the corresponding coverage studies in appendix~\ref{sec:coverage}.
At the end of this section, a detailed comparison of the three methods will be presented, showing the nice agreement among them, as was expected given the good results of the coverage studies show in appendix~\ref{sec:coverage}.

\subsubsection{Feldman-Cousins}
The approach used for the computation of statistical uncertainties, strongly suggested by the CMS statistical committee, is to apply the so-called Feldman-Cousins method~\cite{FC} with nuisance parameters.
Given the enormous time needed for a full 2D scan of the phase space, we decided to perform the F-C procedure only along the maximum of the profile along $P_1$ and $P'_5$, respectively, of the $\mathcal{L}$ distribution.

We consider the $\mathcal{L}$ distribution build fitting the data, and look for the maximum of that distribution along one variable, while the other is fixed.
An evaluation for all the points in the $P_1,~P'_5$ plane for all the bins is not always available, since, for some $P_1,~P'_5$ points, the fit on data keeping $P_1,~P'_5$ fixed, and the yields as well as $A_s^5$ free to float, is not converging.
So, we perform a bivariate Gaussian fit to the $\mathcal{L}$ distribution, and take the maximum of the profiled fitted function instead.
The maximum of the profiled function is always searched for inside the physical region: the results are shown in fig~\ref{fig:profileL}.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Distribution of $\mathcal{L}$ in the $P_1,~P'_5$, with contour curves at DLL=0.5 and 2.0, with the indication of the physical region.
    Superimposed is a bivariate Gaussian fit, and the position of the maxima of the profiled $\mathcal{L}$ (red) and that of the Gaussian fit (blue).}
  \label{fig:profileL}
\end{figure}

This procedure is more robust than just looking for the maximum of the $\mathcal{L}$ on a profile, since we do not have a determination of $\mathcal{L}$ for every bin.
This is typically due to the fact that the physical boundary in the  $P_1,~P'_5$ region depends on $A_s^5$, so the fit of a particular point might converge to a set of values outside the physical region, and so it fails.
Moreover, there is the chance that a determination of the $\log\mathcal{L}$ has a downward fluctuation which can be the minimum even though the shape of the $\log\mathcal{L}$ shows a parabolic behaviour, with a different vertex.
This kind of behaviour can be seen in fig.~\ref{fig:ProblematicPProf}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/FC/ProblematicPProf.pdf}
  \caption{An example for profile of $\log\mathcal{L}$, where it is possible to see the two possible issues to find the minimum just scanning the results, instead of doing a fit.
    Some bins are empty since the fit for those points fails, and there is a downward fluctuation of $\log\mathcal{L}$ which creates a fake minimum.}
  \label{fig:ProblematicPProf}
\end{figure}

For each of the point in the $P_1,~P'_5$ plane defined above, thereafter referred to as GEN-points, we generate a set of 100 toy MC, using the full {\tt pdf}, with data-like statistics, and with nuisance parameter $A_s^5$ which guarantees the wider physical region for $P_1,~P'_5$, namely $0.99$ or $-0.99$, depending on the bin.

Each toy is fitted with a procedure identical to that used for the data, the only difference is that instead of scanning the whole $P_1,~P'_5$ region, only 20 points are scanned, in order to reduce the time needed to perform the whole procedure.
These 20 points are chosen randomly, according to a bivariate Gaussian, around a central value.
The width of the Gaussian is that returned by the fit on the data on the bin under consideration, while correlation is not considered.
The central value is the result of a fit on the toy with $P_1,~P'_5$ free to float, or, if the fit does not converge, the GEN-point itself.
The value of the $\mathcal{L}$ in these 20 points is finally fitted with a bivariate Gaussian, and the best fit for the toy is the maximum of the fitted function.
An example of such a fit is on fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleFC}.

Eventually, for each toy of any GEN-point, a determination of $\mathcal{L}$ is available.
In order to check if the GEN-point is inside or outside the $68\%$ CL region, we compare the $\Delta\log\mathcal{L}$ of the toys with that of the data.
In particular, when computing the boundary of the parameter $P_1$ ($P'_5$), $\Delta\log\mathcal{L}_{toy_{i}}$ is defined, on the projection of $\log\mathcal{L}$ of the $toy_{i}$ on the $P_1$ ($P'_5$) axis, as the difference between the maximum of this projection and its value at $P_1=P_{1~\mathrm{GEN}}$ ($P'_5=P'_{5~\mathrm{GEN}}$), where ($P_{1~\mathrm{GEN}}$, $P'_{5~\mathrm{GEN}}$) are the coordiantes of the GEN-point.
$\Delta\log\mathcal{L}_{Data}$ is defined as the difference between $\log\mathcal{L}$ of the best fit on data and that of the GEN-point.
%% In particular: $\Delta\log\mathcal{L}_{toy_{i}}$ is defined as the difference
%% between the $\log\mathcal{L}$ of the $toy_{i}$ and the $\log\mathcal{L}$ of the
%% GEN-point. $\Delta\log\mathcal{L}_{Data}$ is defined as the difference between
%% $\log\mathcal{L}$ of the best fit on data and that of the GEN-point.

The {\em ratio} is computed as the fraction of toys with DLL lesser than that of the data.
A GEN point is considered inside the $1\sigma$ region, namely the $68.27\%$ CL region, if the ratio is lower than $68.27\%$.
An example of this comparison is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleFC}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/FC/FitGaus2D_Bin7_Reg0_GP3069_Toy7.png}

  \caption{An example of a bivariate fit on the 20 scan points for one GEN-point (left).
    Distribution of the DLL values for the 100 toys for one GEN-point and comparison with DLL for data for that GEN-point (right).}
  \label{fig:ExampleFC}
\end{figure}

The final $68\%$ region for $P_1$ and $P'_5$ is found by looking at the distribution of the ratio as a function of $P_1$ and $P'_5$, respectively, and fitting this distribution with a linear function.
The crossing of the linear function with the $68.27\%$ line defines the $\pm1\sigma$ value.
In total four directions were scanned, corresponding to lower and upper bound for $P_1$ and $P'_5$.

In order to reduce the time consumption of this procedure, which is huge, we started scanning GEN-points around the value of $DLL=0.5$, and then extend the scanned region inside or outside depending on the results.
In case the slope of the linear fit was not very steep, more GEN-points were scanned to make the result more robust.

After a series of optimization, each individual fit to one toy took approximately 4 minutes, so, given that we perform the fit 20+1 times for each toy, the CPU time for each toy is about 1.6 h, including the toy generation, whose contribution is negligible.
We scanned in total about 1000 GEN-points, including many which were not used for the final computation of the FC intervals due to various reasons (debugging of the procedure, different iterations and refinement, etc), for a grand total of about $2\cdot{10^6}$ fits, corresponding to 1.6 year of CPU time.
The whole procedure, including setup, coding, debugging, learning and interpretation of results took about 2.5 months in total.

The results of the FC procedure described above are shown in fig~\ref{fig:FC0}~to~\ref{fig:FC8} for all the seven $q^2$ bins considered.
The intervals, as well as the central values, are summarized in table~\ref{tab:FC}.

\subsubsection{Correlation coefficient}

From the distribution of the likelihood~\ref{fig:profileL} it is also possible to get the correlation coefficient between the two measured parameters, $P_1,~P'_5$.
The $\mathcal{L}$ in the $P_1,~P'_5$ plane is fitted with a bivariate gaussian, with the following expression
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bivariateGauss}
  f(x,y)=\frac{\exp \left\{ -\frac 1{2(1-\rho ^2)}\left[ \left( \frac{x-\mu _x%
      }{\sigma _x}\right) ^2-2\rho \left( \frac{x-\mu _x}{\sigma _x}\right) \left( 
      \frac{y-\mu _y}{\sigma _y}\right) +\left( \frac{y-\mu _y}{\sigma _y}\right)
      ^2\right] \right\} }{2\pi \sigma _x\sigma _y\sqrt{1-\rho ^2}} 
\end{equation}
where $x=P_1$, $y=P'_5$ etc. The $\rho$ parameter in formula~\ref{eq:bivariateGauss} is the correlation coefficient among the two parameters and it is reported in table~\ref{tab:correlation} for all the bins.

\begin{table*}[!htb]

\subsubsection{Comparison of FC with the two other methods ((CM and Hyb)}
In table~\ref{tab:FCcomparison} a detailed comparison of the statistical uncertainties found with the FC procedure are compared with two other approaches proposed.
From the table is possible to see that the two alternative method (CM and Hyb) give intervals which are in very good agreement with the one provided by the FC one, with very few exceptions, where the difference is anyhow limited.
This is in agreement with the coverage studies for the two alternative methods described in sec~\ref{sec:coverage}.
It is worth to stress the huge difference in time spent to compute the intervals with the first two method and the FC one.
The first two can be performed easily once the detailed discretization of the likelihood is done, while the third (FC) required millions of fit, $>1.5$~year of CPU time and two months of work.

\subsection{Results of central values}
\label{sec:res-centval}

The results of the fit on data are summarized in table~\ref{tab:dataresult}.
The {\tt pdf} we use for the final fit, once the two folding have been applied, has 2 physical parameters, $P1$, $P_5'$, which are the results of this analysis.
Other nuisance parameter, left free to float in the fit, are $Y^{C}_{S}$, $Y_{B}$, and $A^5_\mathrm{S}$.

The table presents results for all five parameters.
The errors reported are those from the FC procedure for $P1$, $P_5'$, while are those returned by MINOS for the other three.

The results for $P1$, $P_5'$ and $As5$ are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:fitresultAs5}, Fig~\ref{fig:fitresultP1}, Fig~\ref{fig:fitresultp5}.
On the plots, the predictions from two theoretical groups are also shown.
The orange band shows the predictions from Matias et al\cite{Genon:Swave}.
and the pink band shows the predictions from Paul et al\cite{Paul2015}.
Both predictions are adapted to our $q^2$binning scheme.

We also put the latest LHCb results from Ref.\cite{LHCbP5p} on the plots for comparison, also with only statistical errors.
Note they are using different $q^2$ binnings than us.
